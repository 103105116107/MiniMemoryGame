A lightweight memory matching game developed in Java. This project demonstrates basic game logic, state management, and object-oriented programming principles within a single-class structure.

Features
Core Logic: Implementation of memory card matching mechanics using Java.

Single Class Architecture: Designed to run primarily through a main function and core class for simplicity.

Score Tracking: Basic system to monitor player progress and successful matches.

Portable Code: Written in standard Java, making it compatible with any Java Runtime Environment (JRE).

Technical Details
